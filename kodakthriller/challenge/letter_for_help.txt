David,

That source I was telling you about mailed in another film negative.
We've taken to calling him the "Kodak Thriller" since he hasn't given
us a name and his stories are just too fanciful to be believed. We
tried decrypting this message just like the last one but the result is
gibberish. Maybe you can take a crack at it? If it's like the last
message he'll probably be rambling about being from the future and the
risks of AI if we don't use his "failsafe word". Some of us in the news
room spotted a few patterns that might help you get started.

Good luck!

Paul
