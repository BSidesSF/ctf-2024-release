The disk image and error log provided has many more errors than actual
unreable sectors. This is common and realistic since most drives when
read "normally" don't read one sector at a time but read a whole run
of sectors (aka read-ahead). Requesting a read that extends into a bad
sector can make the whole read fail.  Plotting the error sectors in an
image shows enough that it's clear the flag is in the scratches but
obscures too much to make the flag directly readable.

The solve.pl script tries to read each error sector to figure out
which ones are "true" errors. When those are plotted the flag becomes
easily readable.


$ ./solve.pl > /tmp/flag.data
$ convert -size 512x256 -depth 8 gray:/tmp/flag.data /tmp/flag.png
