Image encrypted with ECB.

Opend in image editor in raw mode and play around with width and color
settings until patterns start appearing.

Correct color is RGBA (4 bytes per pixel)
Correct width is 2048

If you use RGB instead then text is still easily readable with width
2730 or 2731 (these are 4/3rds of 2048)
