In the digital deep, where cold shadows creep,
An ocean of zeros, in silence profound.
From the ether's expanse, without a glance,
The null terminator, its presence resound.

A specter of void, so subtly deployed,
Invisible terrors that weave and confound.
Through binary seas, a malevolent breeze,
A storm of nothing, where hopes run aground.

But closer it draws, with its unyielding jaws,
The null terminator, the end of all codes.
And I, just a byte, in this infinite night,
Await the silence where everything erodes.

The zeros surround me, an army so vast,
Each one a specter in the ghostly parade.
These hollow companions, with emptiness lined,
Form ranks on the horizon, a spectral brigade.

Their numbers are countless, their presence defined
By the void that they carry, and the chill they pervade.
No drumbeat disturbs, yet I feel confined,
In the grasp of the zeros, where light starts to fade.
